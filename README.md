## The process

During development I was able to practice my CSS skills a lot. It was really nice to learn more and get used to coding in this language, which is essential for the frontend stack.



## Next steps

To keep improving and developing myself as a software engineer, I will study new subjects and build more projects in Frontend Mentor.

My next goals are to learn:

- Responsive layout
- Grid layout
